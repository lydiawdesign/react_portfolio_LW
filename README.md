# React Portfolio Lydia Williamson

## Description

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

A portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.
